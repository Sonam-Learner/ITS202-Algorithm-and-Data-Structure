\frametitle{Running Time of Key Indexed Counting }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item key-indexed counting does no compares (it accesses data only through key()). When R is within a constant factor of N, we have a linear-time sort.
		\item O(N+ R)
		R can be characters of alphabets, Hence we ignore R.
		\item O(N)
	\end{itemize}
